        <strong> Welcome to my CV webpage project (ver02082021)! <br> My name is Armands Blumbergs.</strong> <br>
        I am looking for a job in IT - project management OR junior developer (JAVA or WEB - Front-End) even though my
        background is in business management.<br><br>

        WHY?<br><br>

        I had some life changing moment (time) in my life so I reconsidered my life.<br>

        I used to run after money and worked 24x7 for almost 8 years without breaks and run into health problems. Now I
        am good and I spend more time with my family.<br><br>

        IT has always attracted me and now I am learning JAVA and WEB programming.<br>

        I see IT as future and I want to be part of the future. In IT one (or team) can create something that can be
        later used by unlimited number of people and benefit many lives - I admire that.<br>

        I also want to show example to my kids that a person at any age can change his/her life for better and life-work
        balance is important. Money will come.<br><br><br>



        I am learning JAVA because of JAVA community and because many large companies like banks use JAVA. Maybe my
        background in business can add some extra value.<br>

        I am learning WEB (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) - Front-End because it is fun and I can see result right
        away.<br><br><br>



        My educational background is in BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (Riga State 1st Gymnasium, Stockholm School of
        Economics, University of Latvia - MBA - International Business).<br><br>


        My experience background is in PROJECT MANAGEMENT performing various roles.<br><br>


        My role as project manager was to do everything from attracting client to ensuring desired positive result.
        Besides project management I was performing various other roles as well - like business analyst, product owner,
        financial analyst and other. In all roles I was working closely with stakeholders and managing team accordingly.
        I have experience working with innovation, IT, export, training, modernization, infrastructure,
        energy-efficiency and other projects. I was working Agile way applying ideas from Scrum.<br><br><br>

                I am responsible and hard working. During the years I have developed certain my talents but I think that
                responsibility and hard work each day is more important and helps in developing expertise in the field
                and acknowledgement of the details. I always aim for perfection but I know when to stop and keep moving
                forward so that deadlines are always met. If the task allows I love being creative and think out of the
                box also taking into the consideration rules. I love being proactive and taking initiative and
                cooperate. I like also teamwork and achieve goals together. <br><br>

                With my resposible attitude and hard work I have graduated from Riga State 1st Gymnasium and Stockholm
                School of Economics in Riga (SSE-Riga). I have also MBA in International Business from University of
                Latvia. I love learning and try to learn each day taking courses in Udemy or in PluralSight.<br><br><br>

                I have broad work experience as I have worked in different spheres – I was accountant in my student
                years. Later I have done data analysis for State Revenue Service Modernisation project, analysing
                effectiveness and efficiency. In Enterprise Latvia - business consulting company helping to attract and
                manage EU and other funding for Latvian companies - I have worked a lot with different projects in the
                spheres of innovation, investments, IT, export, energy efficiency. I have prepared project documentation
                including business plans and financial analysis. I have evaluated projects prepared by others and done
                data analysis. I have helped implementing projects and prepared final documentation. <br><br>

                Also I have organized different parties in my student years. In Latvian Investment and development
                agency (LIDA) and Enterprise Latvia (EntLv) I have organized a lot of seminars and conferences, and I
                have done public speaking in those events. I have experience in marketing as well as I was LIDA
                Marketing department director and LIDA Marketing project unit director and later in EntLv I was
                responsible for attracting new clients and developing relationships with them. I have managed teams to
                meet deadlines and budget. <br><br>

                In each of the spheres I try to get deep expertise and my broad work experience allows me to learn new
                things easily and see solutions from different angles. Now I am full of energy to get back to labour
                market, work and develop my career. My work experience is described in my LinkedIn profile in more
                detail and I am always ready to meet you and answer all your questions.<br><br><br>
